# DM Shiyam — Task List

> Tasks divided among 3 team members. Priorities: High / Medium / Low.

---

## Person 1: Priyanka — Backend & Infrastructure

*Focus: Token management, security, database, API reliability*

| # | Task | Priority | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Long-lived token exchange** — Exchange short-lived (1hr) tokens for 60-day tokens + auto-refresh before expiry | High | Done |
| 2 | **Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL** — SQLite doesn't support concurrent writes; move to Postgres for production | High | Pending |
| 3 | **User-scoped data isolation** — Add `user_id` FK to `accounts`, `automations`, `activity_log`; filter all queries by user | High | Done |
| 4 | **Rate limiting on webhook endpoint** — Prevent abuse on `POST /api/webhook/instagram` (no auth check currently) | Medium | Done |
| 5 | **DM limit enforcement** — `dms_used_this_month` exists but is never checked before sending; enforce plan limits in `processCommentTrigger` | Medium | Done |
| 6 | **Monthly DM usage reset** — `resetMonthlyDmUsage()` exists but no cron/scheduler calls it | Medium | Done |
| 7 | **Webhook signature verification** — Verify `X-Hub-Signature-256` header from Meta to ensure requests are authentic | Medium | Done |
| 8 | **Error retry logic** — If DM API fails (rate limit, temporary error), implement retry with backoff | Low | Done |
| 9 | **SQL injection in analytics** — `getAnalyticsData` interpolates `days` directly into SQL template strings; use parameterized queries | Medium | Done |
| 10 | **App Review submission** — Prepare and submit `instagram_manage_messages` for Advanced Access | High | Done |

## Person 2: Ankit — Frontend & UX

*Focus: Dashboard improvements, new pages, mobile responsiveness*

| # | Task | Priority | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Fix hydration error properly** — `suppressHydrationWarning` is a band-aid; investigate root cause (browser extensions or layout mismatch) | Medium | Pending |
| 2 | **Signup page** — Build a dedicated `/register` page with proper validation and UX | High | Done |
| 3 | **Password reset flow** — Forgot password functionality (`/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) | High | Done |
| 4 | **Google OAuth setup** — GoogleProvider has empty `clientId/clientSecret`; either configure it or remove the button | Medium | Pending |
| 5 | **Real-time activity feed** — Replace 15s polling with WebSocket/SSE for instant activity updates | Medium | Done |
| 6 | **Mobile-responsive dashboard** — Test and fix dashboard layout on mobile screens | Medium | Done |
| 7 | **Toast notifications** — Add success/error toasts when creating automations, connecting accounts, etc. | Low | Done |
| 8 | **Automation templates** — Pre-built templates ("Lead Magnet", "Discount Code", "Link in Bio") for quick setup | Low | Done |
| 9 | **Dark mode support** — Add theme toggle | Low | Done |
| 10 | **Onboarding wizard** — First-time user setup flow guiding through connecting Instagram and creating first automation | Medium | Done |

## Person 3: Venkat — Features & Integrations

*Focus: New capabilities, billing, deployment*

| # | Task | Priority | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Razorpay billing integration** — Checkout/verify/webhook routes exist but likely untested; complete and test payment flow | High | Done |
| 2 | **Duplicate DM prevention** — If the same user comments the same keyword twice, don't send duplicate DMs; track sent DMs per user per automation | High | Done |
| 3 | **OpenAI integration testing** — AI Smart Replies module exists (`openai.ts`) but needs testing and prompt tuning | Medium | Done |
| 4 | **Multi-account token management** — AccountsTab lets users add accounts, but tokens need validation and refresh logic | Medium | Done |
| 5 | **Export activity logs** — CSV/Excel download of activity data for reporting | Low | Done |
| 6 | **Scheduled automations** — Enable/disable automations on a schedule (e.g., only active during business hours) | Low | Done |
| 7 | **Production deployment** — Dockerize, set up Vercel/Railway deployment, environment config | High | Done |
| 8 | **Terms of Service & Privacy Policy** — Current privacy page is minimal; add proper legal pages | Medium | Done |
| 9 | **Webhook health monitoring** — Dashboard indicator showing last webhook received time, connection status | Medium | Done |
